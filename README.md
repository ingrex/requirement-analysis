** Requirement Analysis in Software Development**

** Introduction**

This repository explores Requirement Analysis in software development. It serves as a foundational guide to understanding how requirements are gathered, analyzed, and validated during the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Through examples and visuals, the content here helps developers, analysts, and stakeholders understand how to define project goals and ensure alignment with business needs.


** What is Requirement Analysis?**
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the SDLC where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented to ensure the development team builds the right product.

It involves understanding what the users need from the system and why they need it. These requirements are used to create a functional baseline and serve as a contract between stakeholders and developers.

** Importance:**
It minimizes misunderstandings and scope creep.

It ensures that the solution meets business goals.

It acts as a reference point throughout development.

 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Reduces Cost and Time Wastage

Identifying clear requirements upfront helps avoid costly rework due to unclear or changing specifications.

Improves Stakeholder Satisfaction

Ensures that the end product matches the client's vision and expectations.

Drives Better Planning

Clear requirements help project managers plan development timelines, resources, and budgets more effectively.

 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Gathering

Collecting high-level business needs through stakeholder meetings, interviews, and questionnaires.

**Requirement Elicitation**

Uncovering hidden requirements using techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, and observation.

**Requirement Documentation**

Creating formal documents like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, and use cases.

**Requirement Analysis and Modeling**

Structuring and prioritizing requirements, and modeling them using tools like flowcharts or UML diagrams.

**Requirement Validation**

Ensuring requirements are complete, feasible, and aligned with business objectives through reviews and feedback loops.

 Types of Requirements
 Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define what a system should do.

Example for a Booking Management Project:

Users can register and log in to the system.

Users can view available rooms and make bookings.

Admin can manage listings and availability.

** Non-functional Requirements**
Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs certain actions.

Example for a Booking Management Project:

The system must load the booking page within 2 seconds.

Data must be encrypted to ensure secure transactions.

The system must support 10,000 concurrent users.

 Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are visual representations of interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help clarify functional requirements and define system boundaries.

 Benefits:
Easy to understand by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Highlights system behavior and user goals.

Supports early validation of functionality.

 Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders. It ensures clarity and aligns the development team with the client's expectations.

 Importance:
Ensures delivered features meet expectations.

Reduces ambiguity in feature implementation.

Supports test-driven development and validation.

 Example â€“ Checkout Feature
Feature: Booking Checkout
Acceptance Criteria:

User must be logged in to proceed to checkout.

System must display a summary of selected booking details.

Payment must be processed via integrated gateway.

Confirmation email is sent upon successful booking.
