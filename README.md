## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves gathering requirements from users, clients, and other stakeholders to understand what the system should do and the constraints under which it must operate.

This phase is a foundational component of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and includes activities like:

- Requirement Elicitation
- Requirement Documentation
- Requirement Validation
- Requirement Management

Requirement Analysis ensures clarity and alignment between stakeholders and developers, reducing the risk of project failure due to misunderstood or missing requirements.

## Importance of Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is vital for several reasons:

- ✅ **Prevents Miscommunication**: Ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software must achieve.
- ✅ **Reduces Rework and Costs**: Identifying errors or gaps early avoids costly fixes during development or after deployment.
- ✅ **Guides Development**: Provides a clear roadmap for developers and designers, improving productivity and efficiency.
- ✅ **Improves User Satisfaction**: Aligns the final product with user expectations, enhancing usability and satisfaction.
- ✅ **Supports Testing and Validation**: Provides a benchmark for writing test cases and validating the system.

In essence, effective requirement analysis bridges the gap between abstract ideas and functional software systems.
